        <p>Hey there,</p>
        <p>It's 2021 and African creatives are still struggling.</p>
        <p>For years, African creatives have been victims of the inability to earn what our work is worth. Somehow, our society has managed to create a dynamic where the creator, the mastermind and the one with the actual talent remains at the bottom of the food chain.</p>
        <p>Sadly, many of us have been forced to fit into boxes that were made to keep us from achieving true creative freedom. We have to present and/or sell our work through organizations and platforms that most times act as gatekeepers and rob us of authenticity, ownership and reward.</p>
        <p>Our time is now.</p>
        <p>With Creathor, we put ourselves in the shoes of every kind of creative out there. Be it as a blogger, writer, filmmaker, artist etc., we have gone back to the basics and have put together a suite of powerful tools for independent creators to create, distribute and monetise their best work with ease.</p>
        <p>Creathor is your stand for creative freedom, and we hope that you stand with us too.</p>
        <p>Philip Obosi, <br>For the Creathor Team.</p>
